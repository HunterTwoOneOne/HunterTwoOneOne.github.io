***This is my personal account, however this repository is specific for my course at Wake Tech.***

**Contents are for my CTI110 related course work, please disregard as training material.**

<H1>About Me:</H1>

*I'm Nathanael, a Network Technician and IT enthusiast. I somewhat always knew my interests were in Information Technology, but didn't find my professional passion until working as a 25N (Nodal Network Systems Operator-Maintainer) in the Army. It was at that point I knew that Switches and Routers were what I was going to work with in my career. When I'm not working I enjoy messing around with computers, playing video games, and tinkering with machines. I play a lot of video games from lots of genres, we don't need to worry about how many tens of thousands of dollars I've put into my library of games. When it comes to 'machines' I really do mean ANY machine from Cars to TVs. I've even worked on assembling my own 2 Stroke Engine in the past.*

<H2>Websites I HIGHLY suggest visiting:</H2>

<a href="https://archive.org/"> Internet Archive </a>

**It's my go-to for software that has long since been abandoned, also called Abandonware. Their efforts for digital preservation are commendable, to say nothing of their general use for an End User. They're a host for all sorts of archived content from snapshots of Webpages, old software, and even media such as books, music, and videos. With documenting history for future generations being such an important part of the human existance, there's only two tools to keep in mind. <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/"> Wikipedia </a> is great if you want information about the history of the world and Internet Archive is great if you want to see the history of the Internet. In the information age, services like Archive.org are invaluable.**

<a href="https://www.speedtest.net"> Ookla Speed Test </a>

**As a Network professional, this website is an invaluable tool. I tell pretty much everybody who's having issues with their WiFi or Ethernet connections to run a speed test, and this is one of the best. It's very simple to use and reasonably accurate for general quick checks of connectivity to the Internet. Ookla offers more than just their speed test tool as they are also the company behind the <a href="https://downdetector.com/"> Down Detector </a> service. If you're an aspiring Network Technician/Engineer, you can benefit greatly from Ookla's website and mobile App. There's almost no other service that competes with Ookla when it comes to reliability and quality in this niche.**

<a href="https://steamdb.info/"> Steam DB </a>

**Being as big a fan of gaming as I am, I would be remiss not to put forward one of the best 3rd Party tools in PC gaming, Steam DB. Their offering of player counts is super helpful in checking if an online game has an active playerbase, viewing upcoming game releases, and a fun little tool to offer a random game you own as a suggestion for what to play. For users deep into modding their games, the ability to find old Depot information to pull an older verion of a game to your machine is invaluable. Everyone who plays games on PC should at least check out Steam DB once.**
