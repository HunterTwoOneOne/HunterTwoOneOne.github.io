#About Me
##I'm Nathanael, a Network Technician and IT enthusiest. I enjoy computers, video games, and tinkering with machines.

##Websites I HIGHLY suggest visiting:
[Internet Archive] (https://archive.org/) - It's my go-to for software that has long since been abandoned, also called Abandonware, and their efforts for digital preservation are commendable.
[Ookla Speed Test] (https://www.speedtest.net) - As a Network professional, this website is an invaluable tool. I tell pretty much everybody who's having issues with their WiFi or Ethernet connections to run a speed test, and this is one of the best.
