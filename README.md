<H1>About Me:</H1>

*I'm Nathanael, a Network Technician and IT enthusiast. I enjoy computers, video games, and tinkering with machines. I somewhat always knew my interests were in Information Technology, but didn't find my professional passion until working as a 25N (Nodal Network Systems Operator-Maintainer) in the Army. I play a lot of video games from lots of genres, we don't need to worry about how many tens of thousands of dollars I've put into my library of games. When it comes to 'machines' I really mean ANY machine from Cars to TVs. Technology as a whole is my true love.*

<H2>Websites I HIGHLY suggest visiting:</H2>

<a href="https://archive.org/"> Internet Archive </a>

**It's my go-to for software that has long since been abandoned, also called Abandonware. Their efforts for digital preservation are commendable, to say nothing of their general use for an End User.**

<a href="https://www.speedtest.net"> Ookla Speed Test </a>

**As a Network professional, this website is an invaluable tool. I tell pretty much everybody who's having issues with their WiFi or Ethernet connections to run a speed test, and this is one of the best. It's very simple to use and reasonably accurate for general quick checks of connectivity to the Internet.**
