# Problem 3 - List Comprehensions

def main():

    """
    This is a function that works with the application of list comprehensions
    using two predefined lists and various assignment required operations.

        Steps:
        1. Defines two starting lists: list_1 and list_2.
        2. Creates list_3: numbers 0â€“5 transformed with the expression (number * 2 - 3).
        3. Creates list_4: nested pairs [Step_C, Step_C_2] generated from ranges,
           filtered so that Step_C is odd and Step_C_2 is even.
        4. Creates list_5: the cube of each number in list_1.
        5. Creates list_6: each element of list_1 multiplied by 3.
        6. Creates list_7: a combined product/sum of elements from list_1 and list_2.
        7. Creates list_8: string combinations of elements from list_1 and list_2 joined with the "@" symbol.
        8. Prints each resulting list after its creation.

    # Step C - More list comprehension

    # Step D - Even more list comprehension
    list_5 = [Step_D ** 3 for Step_D in list_1]
